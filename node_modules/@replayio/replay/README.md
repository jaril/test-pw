# @replayio/replay

CLI tool and node module for managing and uploading [Replay](https://replay.io) recordings.

## Overview

When using the Replay versions of node, playwright, or puppeteer, recordings which are created are saved to disk, by default in `$HOME/.replay`. This package is used to manage these recordings and upload them to the record/replay web service so that they can be viewed.

## Installation

`npm i @replayio/replay --global`

## Usage

```
npx @replayio/replay <command>
```

Possible commands are given below. These may be used with the `--directory <dir>` option to override the default recording directory, or `--server <address>` to override the default server address. When uploading, an API key is required, which can be passed via `--api-key <key>` or by setting the `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` environment variable.

### ls

View information about all known recordings. Prints a JSON array with one descriptor element for each recording. Recording descriptors have the following required properties:

- `id`: ID used to refer to this recording in other commands.
- `createTime`: Time when the recording was created.
- `runtime`: Runtime used to create the recording: either `gecko`, `chromium`, or `node`.
- `metadata`: Any information the runtime associated with this recording. For gecko/chromium recordings this is the URI of the first page loaded, and for node recordings this is the original command line arguments.
- `status`: Status of the recording, see below for possible values.

The possible status values for a recording are as follows:

- `onDisk`: The recording was fully written out to disk.
- `uploaded`: The recording was fully uploaded to the record/replay web service.
- `startedWrite`: The recording started being written to disk but wasn't finished. Either the recording process is still running, or the recording process was killed and didn't shut down normally.
- `startedUpload`: The recording started being uploaded but didn't finish.
- `unusable`: The recording was marked as unusable for some reason, such as a stack overflow occurring.
- `crashed`: The recording process crashed before finishing.
- `crashUploaded`: The recording process crashed and the crash data was uploaded to the record/replay web service for analysis.

Depending on the status the recording descriptor can have some of the following additional properties:

- `path`: If the recording started being written to disk (including before being uploaded), the path to the recording file.
- `server`: If the recording started being uploaded, the address of the server it was uploaded to.
- `recordingId`: If the recording started being uploaded, the server-assigned ID for this recording which can be used to view it.
- `unusableReason`: If the recording is unusable, the reason it was marked unusable.

### upload <id>

Upload the recording with the given ID to the web service.

### process <id>

Upload a recording, and then process it to ensure it can be replayed successfully.

### upload-all

Upload all recordings to the web service which can be uploaded.

### view <id>

View the the given recording in the system's default browser, uploading it first if necessary.

### view-latest

View the most recently created recording in the system's default browser, uploading it first if necessary.

### rm <id>

Remove the recording with the given ID and any on disk file for it.

### rm-all

Remove all recordings and on disk recording files.

### update-browsers

Updates any installed browsers used for recording in automation: [playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replayio/playwright), [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@recordreplay/puppeteer), and [cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@recordreplay/cypress).

## Node Module Usage

This package can be used as a node module to directly access its functionality rather than going through the CLI tool.

Installation:

```
npm i @replayio/replay
```

Usage:

```
const interface = require("@replayio/replay");
```

The interface includes the following members. Options objects can include `directory`, `server`, and `apiKey` properties which behave the same as `--directory`, `--server`, and `--api-key` arguments to the CLI tool, and a `verbose` property which can be set to log the same output as the CLI tool. Any of these properties or the options object themselves can be omitted to use default values.

### listAllRecordings(opts)

Equivalent to `replay ls`, returns the JSON object for the recordings.

### uploadRecording(id, opts)

Equivalent to `replay upload <id>`, returns a promise that resolves with a recording ID if the upload succeeded, or null if uploading failed.

### processRecording(id, opts)

Equivalent to `replay process <id>`, returns a promise that resolves with a recording ID if the upload and processing succeeded, or null if either failed.

### uploadAllRecordings(opts)

Equivalent to `replay upload-all`, returns a promise that resolves with whether all uploads succeeded.

### viewRecording(id, opts)

Equivalent to `replay view <id>`, returns a promise that resolves with whether the recording is being viewed.

### viewLatestRecording(opts)

Equivalent to `replay view-latest`, returns a promise that resolves with whether the latest recording is being viewed.

### removeRecording(id, opts)

Equivalent to `replay rm <id>`, returns whether the recording was removed.

### removeAllRecordings(opts)

Equivalent to `replay rm-all`.

### updateBrowsers(opts)
