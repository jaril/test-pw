# @replayio/playwright

Provides utilities to support using [Replay](https://replay.io) with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)

Use with [replayio/action-playwright](https://github.com/Replayio/action-playwright) to automatically upload replays of failed tests. [Check out our documentation here.](https://docs.replay.io/docs/recording-playwright-b62474b5aadd49e2b0c44a7580b0617e#4f9d9bb360974bf7942f8edae8dcd742)

Exports

- `getExecutablePath(browserName: string)` - Returns the path to the replay browser for the given `browserName`: either `"chromium"` or `"firefox"`. If `browserName` isn't supported on the current platform, `undefined` is returned.
- `devices` - Object of configurations suitable for using with `@playwright/test`. Currently supports `"Replay Firefox"` and `"Replay Chromium"` configurations. If the configuration isn't supported on the current platform, a warning is emitted and the `executablePath` will be undefined.
- `getMetadataFilePath(workerIndex: number = 0)` - Returns the path of a worker-specific metadata file keyed by the `workerIndex`. The file path will be within the `RECORD_REPLAY_DIRECTORY`.

## Using standalone

If you are using `playwright` (rather than `@replayio/playwright`), you can configure it to use the Replay browser by passing in the `executablePath` to `launch()`.

> **Note:** For `firefox`, you must also pass the `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT` environment variable to start recording. This is not required for `chromium` which records all content by default.`

### Metadata

You can add metadata to your playwright recordings using either the `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA` or `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` environment variable. If both are set, `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` takes precedence.

> Currently, this metadata is only available locally except for `title`

- `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` - The path to a file containing JSON-formatted metadata
- `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA` - JSON-formatted metadata string

```js
const playwright = require("playwright");
const { getExecutablePath } = require("@replayio/playwright");

(async () => {
  const browser = await playwright.firefox.launch({
    headless: false,
    executablePath: getExecutablePath("firefox"),
    env: {
      RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: 1,
      RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA: JSON.stringify({
        title: "Screenshot of replay.io"
      })
    },
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://replay.io");
  await page.screenshot({ path: "replay.png" });

  await page.close();
  await browser.close();
})();
```

## Using with `@playwright/test`

`@replayio/playwright` exports a `devices` object with configurations for both `"Replay Firefox"` and `"Replay Chromium"`. These can be added to your `playwright.config.js` to start recording your tests.

```js
// playwright.config.js
// @ts-check
const { devices } = require("@replayio/playwright");

/** @type {import('@playwright/test').PlaywrightTestConfig} */
const config = {
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  use: {
    trace: "on-first-retry",
    defaultBrowserType: "firefox",
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: "firefox",
      use: {
        ...devices["Replay Firefox"],
      },
    },
  ],
};

module.exports = config;
```
